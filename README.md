# TFLphy, a TFL + Giphy API Project
https://dupreesi.github.io/tfl_giphy_fun/

Fun project initially designed and coded by Art, Emily, Kate, Eve from FAC14. I rebuilt it for practicing purposes and had lots of fun doing so. 

Original Project: https://github.com/sima-qian/TfLphy

## User Stories 

- users can select the tube line they wanted to check the status of, preferably from a predefined list (so that we didn't need to worry about misspellings or other inputs).

- Then once the tube line was selected, we'd make an API call to TfL to check on the status of the line. This would be fed back into the DOM to tell the user what the status was.

## Coding proceedure

Two API calls simultaneuosly to Giphy and TFL London. Coded using HTML, CSS and plain Vanilla JS.
